/**
 * In JavaScript, arrays are just another kind of object. Like with objects, you should treat 
 * arrays in React state as read-only. Instead, every time you want to update an array, youâ€™ll want
 * to pass a new array to your state setting function. To do that, you can create a new array from
 * the original array in your state by calling its non-mutating methods like filter() and map().
 * Then you can set your state to the resulting new array.
