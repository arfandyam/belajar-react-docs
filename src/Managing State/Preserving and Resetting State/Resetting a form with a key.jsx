/**
 * Resetting state with a key is particularly useful when dealing with forms.
 * In many apps, preserved state may be the desired behavior, but not in a chat app! You donâ€™t want 
 * to let the user send a message they already typed to a wrong person due to an accidental click.
 * 
 * Adding a key ensures that when you select a different recipient, the Chat component will be 
 * recreated from scratch, including any state in the tree below it. React will also re-create the 
 * DOM elements instead of reusing them.
