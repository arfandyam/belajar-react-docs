You can trigger state updates in response to two kinds of inputs:

1. Human inputs, like clicking a button, typing in a field, navigating a link.
2. Computer inputs, like a network response arriving, a timeout completing, an image loading.

In both cases, you must set state variables to update the UI. For the form youâ€™re developing, 
you will need to change state in response to a few different inputs:

1. Changing the text input (human) should switch it from the Empty state to the Typing state or
 back, depending on whether the text box is empty or not.
2. Clicking the Submit button (human) should switch it to the Submitting state.
3. Successful network response (computer) should switch it to the Success state.
4. Failed network response (computer) should switch it to the Error state with the matching 
 error message.

To help visualize this flow, try drawing each state on paper as a labeled circle, and each change
between two states as an arrow. You can sketch out many flows this way and sort out bugs long
before implementation.
