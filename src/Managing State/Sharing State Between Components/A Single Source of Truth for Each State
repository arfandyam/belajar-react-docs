n a React application, many components will have their own state. Some state may “live” close to the leaf components (components at the bottom of the tree) like inputs. Other state may “live” closer to the top of the app.

For each unique piece of state, you will choose the component that “owns” it. This principle is also known as having a “single source of truth”. It doesn’t mean that all state lives in one place—but that for each piece of state, there is a specific component that holds that piece of information. Instead of duplicating shared state between components, lift it up to their common shared parent, and pass it down to the children that need it.
